# Wyattcraft

A modpack I'm creating to play on an origin modded server

<h2>How to Install</h2>

1. Install the latest version of <a href="https://fabricmc.net/use/">fabric</a> (1.16.5)
2. Download the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/FA1C0Nl-lAWK/Wyattcraft-Modpack/tree/main/Releases">Wyattcraft</a> (they're in the releases folder)
3. Copy the main folder (inside the zip file) and put it somewhere safe (it can't stay in the zip file because you change the contents of a zip file)
4. open Minecraft and create a new installation. For version select release-fabric (there will be a lot of numbers at the end), and for world folder select the folder you downloaded earlier
