# Wyattcraft-creation

A modpack I'm creating to play on an origin modded server

##How to Install

1. Install the latest version of fabric (1.16.5)
2. Download the latest version of Wyattcraft
3. Copy the main folder (inside the zip file) and put it somewhere safe (it can't stay in the zip file because you change the contents of a zip file)
4. open Minecraft and create a new installation. For version select release-fabric (there will be a lot of numbers at the end), and for world folder select the folder you downloaded earlier

##Mods

###Origin Mod - a server side mod that gives the option to select to play as different races in Minecraft.
Keys: use origin (g), see origin (o)
